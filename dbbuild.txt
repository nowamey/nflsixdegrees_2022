Holding some early methods from when the db was the focus, will return to these ideas once the back end methods are working.

def get_data(roster):
    #gets names of every player on the roster for a given year 
    global teamcounter
    for row in roster.find_all('tr'):
            rowsdata = row.find_all('td')
            row = [i.text for i in rowsdata]
            
            #Taking into account undrafted players
            row.append(FULLNAMES[teamcounter])
            
                
            length = len(data)
            print(row)
            
            if(len(row) == 13):

                if(row[11] == ""):
                    row[11] = "Undrafted"
                
                
                if(row[0] != "Team Total"):
                    data.loc[length] = row
    teamcounter+=1
