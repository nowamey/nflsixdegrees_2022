    "For our presentation, we have decided to take on the concept of “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon”, and apply it to the NBA to see how connected all of the current players are. Every edge in our graph of connections symbolizes two players having played on the same team at the same time. Our goal is to create a graphic visualization to obtain a collection of scenarios from the use of our data while analyzing the average length of connection between players.\n"

    "<h2>Retrieval and Preprocessing</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    To retrieve our data from the BasketAPI, We retrieved an authentication key from RapidAPI. The api holds many different categories of basketball data at an international scale, with players and teams referenced all by their own unique id\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "    To get started with our data retrieval, we knew we needed to get a list of all of the active players and their unique ids from the API. Along with that, we needed to be able to connect player ids to some form of record of their history with teams. This resulted in us making two get requests. One the player data of every active player, in which we added all entries into a dataframe mapping id to name. The second get request was done once we had all of the player id’s, where we searched the transaction history for every player id. This gave us date ranges for every player's tenure with each team they have been with in their career. With this, we could build out our graph, making edges signifying that a pair of players were on the same team at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *One edge case we encountered was players who have never been traded. In this case, we had to search their current team with a different API call.*\n",

    "    With the exception of players that spent time as a free agent or were out of the league and returned, the degrees of separation ended up working quite well.

    "\n",
    "*Add graph query here*\n",
    "\n",
    "    A longer example would be for example Trent Forrest to Moses Moody who are 5 degrees separated (the longest we found in the NBA). Forrest was on the Atlanta Hawks in 2022 at the same time as Skylar Mays. Skylar Mays was on the Atlanta Hawks with Justin Holiday towards the tail end of 2022. Justin Holiday shared a team (Golden State Warriors) with Andre Iguadala between 2014-2015. And finally, Moses Moody is currently on the Warriors with Andre Iguadala.\n",

    "\n",
    "    On this graph, the bigger the point is, the more connections that the player has. The graph shows that players such as Jeff Green, D.J. Augustin, and Justin Holiday have the biggest points, meaning that they have more connections. This would make sense because each of these three players have played for at least 11 teams meaning that they have had many different teammates throughout their careers.\n",
    "    We found that the most connections it would take between any two players is five. This proves that there is actually only 5 degrees of separation between any two players, proving Bacon’s Law of 6 degrees of separation. A point that can be made about the aforementioned longest example, both players are in their first couple years in the NBA, which limits the amount of teammates that they have played with, and makes it harder to find connections, making their degree of separation longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It would be interesting to look at this for other sports as well to determine what the maximum degrees of separation is in other pro leagues, and see if those other sports also have less than or equal to 6 degrees of separation at the maximum. \n"

    "<h2>Limitations</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "    The main limitation of this project is that we are only considering connections through active NBA players (as of 2023). This means we cannot search for connections between retired players and connections that exist between current and retired players are not considered in our analysis. The main reason for this was that our team decided that including retired player data would be too large of a dataset to wrangle. The active player dataset was already proving difficult for our team to visualize and adding players and edges to the graph was making our graph even harder to visualize. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Another issue that arises with our data is the way the NBA handles its drafts. When a player is drafted to a team our dataset automatically assigns that player to the team, but oftentimes a team will trade a player immediately after drafting them. This means we have player data in our dataset that includes players who were on a team for only 1 day. Our team decided that this data would still be considered when finding a path because the player was still technically on the same team with other players albeit for 1 day.\n"
